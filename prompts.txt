# Prompt used for generating synthetic e-commerce data:
Create a Python script that generates synthetic e-commerce data and stores it in around 5 CSV files:
- customers.csv
- products.csv
- orders.csv
- order_items.csv
- reviews.csv

Use Faker for names, emails, descriptions, and timestamps.  
Make sure IDs match properly between tables (customer_id, product_id, order_id).  
Add random prices, quantities, order statuses, and ratings so the data is suitable for running SQL joins later.

------------------------------------------------------------

# Prompt used for creating the SQLite ingestion script:
Write a Python script that reads the 5 CSV files and loads them into a SQLite database named ecom.db.
The script should:
- Create tables (customers, products, orders, order_items, reviews)
- Use appropriate columns and primary keys
- Use Python's sqlite3 + csv modules
- Insert every row from each CSV into the correct table

Keep the script simple and easy to run.

------------------------------------------------------------

# Prompt used for generating SQL queries:
Write SQL queries for a SQLite database that:
1. Calculates order totals by joining orders and order_items
2. Finds top customers by total spend
3. Shows product sales, revenue, and average rating (joins with reviews)
4. Lists recent orders along with customer email and all product names in that order

Return valid SQLite SQL that I can run directly.
